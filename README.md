# R-tasks
Combined ui.R and server.r are for:
Shiny app of type client-server that shows features of option based on Blackâ€“Scholes Option Pricing Model (it shows call and  put prices depending on strike)
This app can calculate call price and put price if price of an underlying asset is from [80, 120] for all strike prices from 80 to 120 if volatility is from [0.1, 0.5] and time before expiration time from [0.1, 1.5].
risk-free interest rate is r=0.03, dividend yield is q=0.

Task_0.R defines a distribution of sample given in Task0.csv.

Task_1.R: have 3 samples from Task1.csv, have to evaluate regression model y = a0+a1x1+a2x2+a3x3+noise and delete insignificant variables(if they exist), after that evaluate new regression model; also have to define a distribution of noise and check if they are uncorrelated.

Task_2.R: using data from Task2.csv have to identify ARMA models and evaluate some of them, choose the best one from evaluated ones and also research residuals.
